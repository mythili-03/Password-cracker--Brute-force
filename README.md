# Password-cracker--Brute-force

This project will help us to crack the password entered by the user. this project id developed based on Brute force Algorithm. The brute force attack is still one of the most popular password-cracking methods. Nevertheless, it is not just for password cracking. Brute force attacks can also be used to discover hidden pages and content in a web application. This attack is basically “a hit and try” until you succeed. This attack sometimes takes longer, but its success rate is higher. A brute force program attempts every possible solution when cracking a password. These are not just useful for hacking but can be applicable in many programs. They are often inefficient and time consuming because they are so thorough.
